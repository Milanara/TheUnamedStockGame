# TheUnamedStockGame
 A game I'm designing based off of a board game my family loved to play called Stock Ticker. I always hated how absolutely random the game was, leaving little chance for strategy, so my plan is to add in trends and events, and generally things that would be too complicated for a simple board game, but that a computer can handle with ease.
